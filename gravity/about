Concept

general objects:
	field, buttons, textbox, help.
field:
	it drows every point(possibly some relations between them)
buttons:
	there are buttons and antibuttons
	after click on button some points move(it is known that during the program this movement doesn't change)
	antibutton for reverse motion
textbox:
	a field for code(probably more then one language)
	you can run the code and motion of points can be seen on field
	
	code:
		first of all player have commands which click on buttons
		also there is a vector of points(current positions)
		!!this vector could be changed only by click on button
		libraries and standart depends on language( for c++ stl ) 
help:
	here should be all avaliable standart functions(as ClickButton1)

Main idea

	Every level asks(or not, it may be a riddle) player to make a figure from points. 
	It can be done by hands, but because of assimptotics and precision it's recomended to make a code.
	Maybe complex solution will be avaliable. As a log file.
