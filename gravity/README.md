**SIMULATION and VISUALISATION of gravitational interaction**

*Simulation*

All objects are points with mass and speed in three dimensions.
Every step(time dt) every object has acceleration calculated by the law of gravity(summ vector each whith each).
Then all speeds are recalculated and new positions are known.


*Visualisation*

SFML library.
Position of each object normalize to screen size. Every object is a circle shape(radius depends on mass)
